# Goals

Greek 101 is the first semester of an ambitious new two-semester sequence to introduce you to the study of ancient Greek.  Our curriculum is inspired by the Latin 101-102 sequence developed by several members of our department at Holy Cross, led by [Professor Machado](https://dominicmachado.github.io), and shares a directly parallel set of overarching goals.  By the end of this course, you will:

  - identify ways that  language structures our understanding of the world we live in
  - articulate how the Greek language has shaped and continues to shape structures of power in the modern world
  - read and pronounce Greek with confidence and accuracy
  - analyze syntax and sentence structure in Greek and English
  - express complex ideas in written composition both in Greek and in English
  - read authentic, unaltered Greek texts with minimal glossing




# Community-based learning

Community-based learning (CBL) is an essential part of our course.  We are privileged to be be able to study Greek together in our MWF class meetings.  In your CBL work, you will share some of that experience with others. Community-based learning helps us to understand our language study in a broader context. The active engagement it requires also will improve your development of the language skills required for your study of Greek.

Your CBL work will include a weekly CBL section meeting on campus, and a small-group project that will include work in the community.

In the fall semester of 2022, our community partner will be the Worcester Art Museum.




# Organization of the course

## Textbook

The fall semester course is organized in four modules centered on four major ideas about the ancient Greek language. On our course website, each module identifies concrete objectives that will help you achieve the broader course goals summarized above.

The four modules correspond closely to modules 1-4 in the textbook we will be using, which you can purchase directly from the Classics Department office. The text will be available this fall in two installments:  packet 1 will be available the first week of classes; packet 2 will be available after fall break.  In addition, you can always find a current on-line version at [https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/](https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/), and can always download a current PDF of the textbook from [https://github.com/hellenike/textbook/raw/main/pdf/hellenike.pdf](https://github.com/hellenike/textbook/raw/main/pdf/hellenike.pdf).

After introducing features of the ancient Greek language, each module of the textbook includes reading that connects the topics you are studying to contemporary experience, and concludes with a reading selection from an authentic ancient text.  This year, our reading will be drawn from a defense speech composed by the orator Lysias in a murder trial.

You can learn more about how the textbook is organized in sections 1 ("Hellênikê / ἑλληνική: an open-source introduction to ancient Greek") and 2 ("About this textbook") of the textbook.

The textbook also has an accompanying youtube channel and playlist at [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhhpSgbqjgokrwa4HmReaGEptvqURz6Ns](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhhpSgbqjgokrwa4HmReaGEptvqURz6Ns).

## Technologies and mechanics of submitting assignments

All course material will be available on the course web site at [https://neelsmith.github.io/greek101/](https://neelsmith.github.io/greek101/).  You can use Canvas to submit written assignments, and review your progress in completing graded assignments.

Written assignments should be written in clearly and legibly in dark pencil on paper.  You can submit the assignments directly to Canvas if you have the Canvas Student app on a cell phone. If you do not have access to the Canvas Student app on a phone, please get in touch with me, and we can make arrangements for submitting your homework in paper.  If you have technical problems submitting an assignment, please get in touch with Educational Technology Services and ask for help.




# What to expect

## How to succeed




# Course requirements and grades

You determine your own course grade by satisfactorily completing a number of assignments in three categories:

  - written and oral assignments for class preparation
  - longer portfolio assignments
  - work in CBL lab

All assignments will be graded satisfactory/unsatisfactory according to an explicit specification of requirements: if you complete all requirements, the assignment is satisfactory.

## Class preparation

The course schedule includes twenty brief assignments as part of your routine class preparation, eighteen to be submitted in writing, and two oral assignments. Each assignment can earn up to two points: one point for a completed submission by 5:00 pm the day *before* class, and a second point for a grade of satisfactory.  The total points you can earn in this category is twenty.

The specifications for these assignments are straightforward: a submission is satisfactory if all responses are correct; errors are not satisfactory. If you submit an assignment on time (earning one point), but have an error, you may resubmit a corrected assignment as often as you like up until the deadline for final revisions for that module. When a revised submission is satisfactory a second point will be recorded for that assignment.

## Portfolio assignments

Over the course of the semester, you will develop a portfolio of ten longer assignments. Four of these will demonstrate mastery of basic features of language by analyzing and explaining forms and constructions; three will be analyses and translations of passages in Greek; three  will be compositions in Greek.

Throughout the semester, we will set aside class meetings to workshop drafts of these longer assignments.

As with class preparation assignments, each portfolio assignment earns one point for a complete submission on time, and a second point if it completes all requirements to achieve a satisfactory grade.  Like class preparation assignments, portfolio assignments may be revised as often as you like up to the deadline for revisions for each module. You can earn a total of 20 points in this category.

## CBL lab

Throughout the year, you will participate in a weekly CBL lab led by an alumna or alumnus of last year's Greek 101/102 course.  In the fall semester we will be working with the Worcester Art Museum on a project (MORE INFORMATION TBA)

You will receive two grades for CBL lab work>

  - participation: ten CBL sections are scheduled to meet at Holy Cross.  You earn one point for each section you attend, for a possible total of 10.
  - project: satisfactory completion of projects in 3 steps. Each step can earn 2 points, for a total possible of 6 points.

## Determination of final course grade

Your course grade will be recorded from this table.  In the row for each grade, the numbers in each column represent the minimum number of points required in that category.

| Course grade | Portfolio (out of 20) | Class preparation (out of 40) | CBL participation (out of 10) | CBL project (out of 16) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
| A | 20 | 38 |  10 | 15 |

# Peer tutoring

The Department of Classics and the Classics Department Inclusion Committee offer a peer-based tutoring program for Greek 101 students. The tutors have received training through Academic Services and Learning Resources, and can discuss course with ou, help you understand how to solve problems, and suggest independent learning strategies.

Tutoring workshops run as an appointment-based service of 40-minute sessions, at time arranged between you and the Peer Tutor. To set up an appointment with one of the tutors, please contact your professor.
