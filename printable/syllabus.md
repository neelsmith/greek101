## Goals and objectives

Greek 101 is the first semester of an ambitious new two-semester sequence to introduce you to the study of ancient Greek.  Our curriculum is inspired by the Latin 101-102 sequence developed by several members of our department at Holy Cross, led by [Professor Machado](https://dominicmachado.github.io).

  - Explain how language structures the world we live in
  - Articulate how the Greek language has shaped and continues to shape structures of power in the modern world
  - Read and pronounce Greek with confidence and accuracy
  - Analyze syntax and sentence structure in Latin and English
  - Translate complex ideas and sentences into Latin and English
  - Read real, unedited Latin texts with minimal glossing

## What to expect

### Organization of course

### Textbook

Our textbook is the first release of *Hellênikê / ἑλληνική: an open-source introduction to ancient Greek*, which you can purchase directly from the Classics Department Office.  The text will be available this fall in two installments:  packet 1 will be available the first week of classes; packet 2 will be available after fall break.

You can always find a current on-line version at [https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/](https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/), and can always download a current PDF from [https://github.com/hellenike/textbook/raw/main/pdf/hellenike.pdf](https://github.com/hellenike/textbook/raw/main/pdf/hellenike.pdf).

### How to succeed




## Course requirements and grades

You determine your own course grade by satisfactorily completing a number of assignments in three categories:

  - written and oral assignments for class preparation
  - longer portfolio assignments
  - work in CBL lab

All assignments will be graded satisfactory/unsatisfactory according to an explicit specification of requirements: if you complete all requirements, the assignment is satisfactory.

### Class preparation

The course schedule includes twenty brief assignments as part of your routine class preparation, eighteen to be submitted in writing, and two oral assignments. Each assignment can earn up to two points: one point for a completed submission by 5:00 pm the day *before* class, and a second point for a grade of satisfactory.  The total points you can earn in this category is twenty.

The specifications for these assignments are straightforward: a submission is satisfactory if all responses are correct; errors are not satisfactory. If you submit an assignment on time (earning one point), but have an error, you may resubmit a corrected assignment as often as you like up until the deadline for final revisions for that module. When a revised submission is satisfactory a second point will be recorded for that assignment.

### Portfolio assignments

Over the course of the semester, you will develop a portfolio of ten longer assignments. Four of these will demonstrate mastery of basic features of language by analyzing and explaining forms and constructions; three will be analyses and translations of passages in Greek; three  will be compositions in Greek.

Throughout the semester, we will set aside class meetings to workshop drafts of these longer assignments.

As with class preparation assignments, each portfolio assignment earns one point for a complete submission on time, and a second point if it completes all requirements to achieve a satisfactory grade.  Like class preparation assignments, portfolio assignments may be revised as often as you like up to the deadline for revisions for each module. You can earn a total of 20 points in this category.

### CBL lab

Throughout the year, you will participate in a weekly CBL lab led by an alumna or alumnus of last year's Greek 101/102 course.  In the fall semester we will be working with the Worcester Art Museum on a project (MORE INFORMATION TBA)

You will receive two grades for CBL lab work>

  - participation: ten CBL sections are scheduled to meet at Holy Cross.  You earn one point for each section you attend, for a possible total of 10.
  - project: satisfactory completion of projects in 3 steps. Each step can earn 2 points, for a total possible of 6 points.

## Determination of final course grade

Your course grade will be recorded from this table.  In the row for each grade, the numbers in each column represent the minimum number of points required in that category.

| Course grade | Portfolio (out of 20) | Class preparation (out of 40) | CBL participation (out of 10) | CBL project (out of 16) |

## Peer tutoring

The Department of Classics and the Classics Department Inclusion Committee offer a peer-based tutoring program for Greek 101 students. The tutors have received training through Academic Services and Learning Resources, and can discuss course with ou, help you understand how to solve problems, and suggest independent learning strategies.

Tutoring workshops run as an appointment-based service of 40-minute sessions, at time arranged between you and the Peer Tutor. To set up an appointment with one of the tutors, please contact your professor.
