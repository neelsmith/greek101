In this week's CBL activity at the Worcester Art Museum, a docent will introduce you to the museum.  In the Greek gallery, think about which artifacts might have been used in the distinct men's and women's spheres of a house like Euphiletos'.  Be on the lookout as well for images of men and women in funerary memorials.  In addition to the fragment of a funerary stele of a woman in the Greek gallery, there are two large stelae of men in the large Renaissance court (with the hunt mosaic), and adjacent to that, in the Roman gallery, a funerary marker excavated at Antioch.

The gallery across from the Greek gallery is home to the temporary exhibit, "Jewels of the Nile."  It can give you ideas about the different ways the museum has planned to use that gallery space to engage different audiences.

You may find that your docent tour raises more questions than you are able to explore in one visit.  Remember that your Holy Cross ID gets you free access to the museum whenever they are open, and consider returning for a less rushed visit before your CBL section next week, when we'll be discussing ideas for CBL projects.

Remember to read information on museum labels critically, look closely at the objects on display, and enjoy your visit!
