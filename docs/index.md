## Announcements



## Week at a glance: Sept. 26 - Sept. 30 

- **Sept. 26**: [Vocabulary list](./module2/vocab/) for module 2 available

### MWF classes

We begin Module 2, "Nouns and adjectives," by learning how to use *cases* to express the function of nouns.  We focus on :

- *naming* the subject with the *nominative* case
- using a noun to describe another noun with the *genitive* case
- identifying the *direct object* of a verb with the *accusative* case
- identifying the *indirect object* of a verb with the *dative* case

### CBL

Small groups go to Worcester Art Museum for docent tours.

Assignment:


- In Canvas, upload a selfie of yourself in the WAM with some object you found interesting enough to want to look at again.  (This does not count as a separate grade, but is included as part of your attendance grade for this week's CBL section.)
