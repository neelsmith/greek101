# Greek 101-01, F'23: home page

Welcome to the course web site for Greek 101, section 1! 

Full content will be available here during the first week of classes.

## Preparation for first class

Greek 101 has two components: our regular MWF class (meeting at 9:00 in Beaven 113), and an additional Community-Based Learning (CBL) lab.  

Our MWF meetings begin on Wednesday, Aug. 30; CBL lab meetings begin the following week (week of Sept. 4-9).

Before coming to the first class on Wednesday, you should learn the Greek alphabet.  Please see [this class assignment](./classes/module1/intro/).
