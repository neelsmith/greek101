### MWF classes

We begin Module 2, "Nouns and adjectives," by learning how to use *cases* to express the function of nouns.  This week, we focus on the nominative and genitive cases to express:

- *naming* the subject of any finite verb or the predicate of a linking verb with the *nominative* case 
- using a noun to describe another noun with the *genitive* case

We learn how to use the article and the demonstrative pronouns together with nouns.


### CBL

Small groups go to Worcester Art Museum for docent tours.

Assignment:


- In Canvas, upload a selfie of yourself in the WAM with some object you found interesting enough to want to look at again.  (This does not count as a separate grade, but is included as part of your attendance grade for this week's CBL section.)

### Due dates


Written daily assignments: 

- Sunday: substantives
- Tuesday: the nominative and genitive cases

- Thursday: [composition 1](https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/practice/module1/portfolio/composition/)
