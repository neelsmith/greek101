# What used to be new: older announcements


- **Sept. 6**: you should have received an email scheduling your CBL visit to the WAM next week. Please **complete the CBL registration form as soon as possible**.
- **Sept. 4**: New [resources and tips](../resources/) pages adds links to off-site resources.  As the semester progresses, we'll add review material and other material to help you review.
- **Sept. 4**:  Updated textbook for F23 now available. (Use links at the top of all pages on this site to read on the web or to download a complete PDF. Hard copy will be distributed in class *gratis*, courtesy of the Classics Department.)
- **Sept. 3**: Please include *questions* as part of your written homework: this will help make your corrected homeworks a useful reference you can study from. (Answers alone won't do that very well.)
- **Sept. 1**: CBL sections begin **Sept. 4** and **Sept. 5**. TAs will set up groups for each section in GroupMe.
