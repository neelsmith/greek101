# Participles

In the final module of the fall semester, we will learn about one of the most distinctive features of the Greek language, *participles*. Participles are the most common form of *subordination* in Greek. At the completion of this module, you will be able to read extensive passages of Greek with complete sentences using participles to express subordinate verbal ideas.
