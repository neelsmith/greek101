# The aorist indicative

Read sections 4.2-4.7 of your textbook.  (On the web, that begins with "[Verbal units](http://localhost:4001/topics/verbalunits/)", and runs through "[The aorist indicative](http://localhost:4001/topics/aorist/)").

Memorize the third person singular and plural forms of the aorist in the active, middle and passive voices.
