## Review of aorist indicative 

Review section 4.7 of your textbook, "The aorist indicative."  Review any comments on your previous homework submission.

In class, we will practice recognizing and creating finite verb forms in all three voices of the aorist.  Bring any questions you might have about verbs or this verb tense to class.

### Optional

There is no written assignment for today: you can use this opportunity to revise and resubmit your previous homework.

If you feel confident about what we have done with the aorist indicative, feel free look ahead at section 4.8, "The imperfect indicative."
