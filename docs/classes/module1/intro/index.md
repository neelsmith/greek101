# Introduction to course

Before coming to class, please read [section 3.1 of the Hellênikê textbook, "The Greek alphabet"](https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/preliminaries/alphabet/).  

- memorize the letters in alphabetic order
- use the exercise in the textbook to [practice reading words aloud](https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/practice/module1/practice/vocalizing-greek/)

As always, bring your questions to class!



## Optional practice
