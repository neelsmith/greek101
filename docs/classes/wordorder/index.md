# Word order

Word order in Greek is not as rigidly determined as in English, but it *is* meaningful.  As preparation for your first composition, we'll look at some sentences in Lysias and consider his choices of word order.  We'll try to identify common patterns of word order, and consider why in some contexts he departs from his more common practice.

We will look at the passages together at sight:  you do not need to prepare separately for this class work.  Use the class preparation time to review material from Module 1 (section 11.2 of your textbook, online here) as you revise your analysis and translation assignment.
