# Participles: introduction, and formation of the first aorist participle

Read [sections 6.1](https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/topics/module3/participles1/) ("Participles: introduction") through [section 6.4](https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/topics/module3/aoristparticiples/) ("First aorist participles") in your textbook's chapter on participles.


Like finite verb forms, participles have *tense* and *voice*. As in all other forms of the Greek verb, the *aorist* forms of the participle use the *third* principal part for the active and middle voices, and the *sixth* principal part for the passive voice.  

Like adjectives, the endings of participles show us gender, case and number of the noun they agree with. The endings of the aorist participle are completely regular, but use endings from all three declensions: participles are a great way to review regular endings of nouns and adjectives for all three declensions!

- The first aorist *active* uses the third principal part and adds endings following a *3-1-3* pattern, that is, third declension endings for the masculine and neuter, and first declension endings for the feminine.
- The first aorist *middle* uses the third principal part and adds endings following a *2-1-2* pattern, that is, second declension endings for the masculine and neuter, and first declension endings for the feminine.
- The aorist *passive* uses the sixth principal part and adds endings following a *3-1-3* pattern, that is, third declension endings for the masculine and neuter, and first declension endings for the feminine.
