# The present and second aorist participles

In your textbook, read [section 6.5](https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/topics/module3/presentparticiples/) ("Present participles of -ω / thematic verbs") and [section 6.6](https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/topics/module3/aorist2participles/) ()"Second aorist participles").

As with all other forms of the verb, all three voices of the *present* tense are formed from the *first* principal part.  *Second aorist forms*, like first aorist forms, use the *third* principal part to form the active and middle voices.  Just as finite verbs use the same endings for the *imperfect* tense and the second aorist, so participles use the same endings for the *present* tense of the participle and second aorist forms of the participle.  As with finite verb forms, verbs using second aorist endings to create the active and middle voices from the third principal part with form the aorist passive from the sixth part, exactly like first aorist verbs.


- The *present active* and *second aorist active* add endings following a 3-1-3 pattern, that is, third declension endings for the masculine and neuter, and first declension endings for the feminine.
- The *present middle* and *second aorist middle* add endings following a 2-1-2 pattern, that is, second declension endings for the masculine and neuter, and first declension endings for the feminine.
- The *present passive* forms are identical to the present middle forms (just like finite verbs)
- The *aorist passive* forms work the same way for first and second aorists: they use the sixth principal part and add endings following a 3-1-3 pattern, that is, third declension endings for the masculine and neuter, and first declension endings for the feminine.
