# Participles of contract verbs

In your textbook, read section 6.11, "Participles of contract verbs," online [here](https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/topics/module3/contractparticiples/).

Test yourself with the verbs τελευτάω and ἡγέομαι. 

Could you create the nominative and genitive singular for each cell in the following table?  E.g., if we were using κελεύω, the Masculine entry for present active would be κελεύων, κελεύοντος  and the Feminine entry would be κελεύουσα, κελευούσης.

| Tense, voice | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---  |
| Present active | | | |
| Present middle | | | |
| Present passive | | | |
| Aorist active | | | |
| Aorist middle | | | |
| Aorist passive | | | |
