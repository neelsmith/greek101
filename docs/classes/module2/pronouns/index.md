# Pronouns

In your text read the section on "Demonstrative pronouns," online [here](https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/topics/module2/demonstratives/).

Memorize the nominative and genitive forms of ὅδε/ἥδε/τόδε, οὗτος/αὕτη/τοῦτο and ἐκεῖνος/ἐκείνη/ἐκεῖνο.  Notice that the irregular stems of ὅδε/ἥδε/τόδε, οὗτος/αὕτη/τοῦτο occur in exactly the same places where the irregular stems of the article occur (and look like the article);  the one oddity to highlight in ἐκεῖνος/ἐκείνη/ἐκεῖνο is the neuter nominative singular: otherwise, its endings are the same as regular nouns of the first declension (in the feminine forms) and second declension (in the masculine and neuter forms).

Memorize also the nouns in the vocabulary list for unit 1.

We will practice using these pronouns and nouns together in class.
