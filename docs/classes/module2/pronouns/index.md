# Pronouns and adjectives


In your text read section 5.10, "Adjectives" and 5.11, "Demonstrative pronouns," online here:


- [5.10](https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/topics/module2/demonstratives/), "Adjectives"

## Forms of demonstrative pronouns

Memorize and be able to produce the complete forms of οὗτος/αὕτη/τοῦτο and ἐκεῖνος/ἐκείνη/ἐκεῖνο.  Notice that the irregular stems of οὗτος/αὕτη/τοῦτο occur in exactly the same places where the irregular stems of the article occur (and look like the article);  the only oddity to highlight in ἐκεῖνος/ἐκείνη/ἐκεῖνο is the neuter nominative and accusative singular: otherwise, its endings are the same as regular nouns of the first declension (in the feminine forms) and second declension (in the masculine and neuter forms).



οὗτος, αὕτη, τοῦτο "this"

| Case and number | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
| --- | --- | --- | ---  |
| Nominative Singular	| οὗτος | αὕτη| τοῦτο|
| Masculine Genitive Singular |	τούτου |ταύτης |τούτου |
| Masculine Dative Singular |	τούτῳ | ταύτῃ|τούτῳ |
| Masculine Accusative Singular |	τοῦτον |ταύτην |τοῦτο |
| Masculine Nominative Plural |	οὗτοι | αὗται| ταῦτα|
| Masculine Genitive Plural |	τούτων |τούτων |τούτων |
| Masculine Dative Plural |	τούτοις | ταύταις| τούτοις|
| Masculine Accusative Plural |	τούτους |ταύτας |ταῦτα |

ἐκεῖνος, ἐκείνη, ἐκεῖνο "that"

| Case and number | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
| --- | --- | --- | ---  | 
| Masculine Nominative Singular | 	ἐκεῖνος | ἐκείνη|ἐκεῖνο |
| Masculine Genitive Singular | 	ἐκείνου |ἐκείνης | ἐκείνου|
| Masculine Dative Singular | 	ἐκείνῳ | ἐκείνῃ|ἐκείνῳ |
| Masculine Accusative Singular | 	ἐκεῖνον | ἐκείνην|ἐκεῖνο |
| Masculine Nominative Plural | 	ἐκεῖνοι |ἐκεῖναι | ἐκεῖνα|
| Masculine Genitive Plural | 	ἐκείνων |ἐκείνων |ἐκείνων |
| Masculine Dative Plural | 	ἐκείνοις |ἐκείναις |ἐκείνοις |
| Masculine Accusative Plural | 	ἐκείνους |ἐκείνας | ἐκεῖνα|





Be able to recognize and identify the forms of ὅδε/ἥδε/τόδε. Notice that its forms are identical to the form of the article + -δε, with the one exception where the article has proclitic forms (the masculine and feminine nominative forms), and hence no accent, the forms of ὅδε/ἥδε/τόδε have an acute accent on the penult.  Note also that the forms of ὅδε/ἥδε/τόδε otherwise retain the same accent as the article, *even when this appears to break our normal accent rules*.  For example, we would expect the masculine accusative plural form τούσδε to have a circumflex (accent on a long penult when the ultima is short), but instead it has the same acute accent as the masculine accusative plural form of the article.


ὅδε, ἥδε, τόδε "this one"

| Case and number | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
| --- | --- | --- | ---  | 
| Masculine Nominative Singular | 	ὅδε |ἥδε | τόδε|
| Masculine Genitive Singular | 	τοῦδε |τῆσδε | τοῦδε|
| Masculine Dative Singular | 	τῷδε |τῇδε | τῷδε|
| Masculine Accusative Singular | 	τόνδε |τήνδε |τόδε |
| Masculine Nominative Plural | 	οἵδε | αἴδε| τάδε|
| μasculine Genitive Plural | 	τῶνδε | τῶνδε| τῶνδε|
| Masculine Dative Plural | 	τοῖσδε | ταῖσδε| τοῖσδε|
| Masculine Accusative Plural | 	τούσδε | τάσδε| τάδε|
