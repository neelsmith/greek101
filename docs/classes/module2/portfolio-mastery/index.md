# Module 2: pronouns and adjectives: mastery

## Part A: Analyzing texts




> ἔδοξε γὰρ **τῷ Ἐυφιλήτῳ** γῆμαι καὶ **γυναῖκα** ἠγάγετο εἰς **τὴν οἰκίαν**. **παιδίον** δὲ αὐτῷ ἐγένετο, καὶ ἐπίστευε ἤδη καὶ **πάντα τὰ ἑαυτοῦ** **ἐκείνῃ** παρέδωκε. ἐν μὲν οὖν **τῷ πρώτῳ χρόνῳ**,
**πασῶν** ἦν **βελτίστη**.

Glossary:


- βέλτιστος, βελτίστη, βέλτιστον, "best"
- ἑαυτοῦ, genitive of a personal pronoun, "of him, his"
- πρῶτος, πρώτη, πρῶτον, "first"
 

1. Find each substantive phrase highlighted **like this** in the selection above.  By substantive phrase, we mean a reference to a substantive that could possibly include the article and attributive expressions; treat predicate expressions (noun or adjective) as a separate phrase.
2. Fully identify each substantive form in the phrases you identified in 1.
2.  Break up the passage above into clauses. Copy each clause onto a separate line.  Underline connecting words; circle finite verbs; draw a box around direct objects; bracket  prepositional phrases within parentheses.

## Part B: Composing Greek forms

Complete a declension of the phrase "that unjust citizen."

| Case | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nominative | |
| Genitive | |
| Dative | |
| Accusative | |



Compose a Greek prepositional phrase to express the **highlighted expression**:

1. He went **into the field** **with the child**.
2. In fact, he acted **illegally**, although he thought he acted **in accordance with the law.**
3. They went **out of the house.**
4. He saw her  **in the market place.**
5. He held strong opinions **concerning the penalty.**
6. **In the earliest time** of their marriage, Euphiletos considered her the perfect wife.
