## The nominative and genitive cases

In your textbook, read sections 5.6, "The genitive case" through 5.8, "Nominative and genitive cases," on line here:

- [5.6](https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/topics/module2/genitive-case/), "The genitive case"
- [5.7](https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/topics/module2/forming-nouns/), "Forming nouns with case endings"
- [5.8](https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/topics/module2/nom-gen-endings/), "Nominative and genitive cases"


Using the vocabulary  list for module 2, compose two Greek expressions for each English noun phrase. Assume that the noun phrase functions as the subject of a sentence, and compose two Greek versions using different forms of the attributive position. 

1.  The death of the citizen
2.  The person's (*a man*) vengeance
3. The servant/slave/attendant of the person (*a woman*)
4. The fields of the people
5. The death of the slave
