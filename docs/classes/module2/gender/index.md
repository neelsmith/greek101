# Ancient views on grammatical gender



Read Tom Hendrickson's article, "Gender Diversity in Greek and Latin Grammar: [Ten Ancient Discussions](https://medium.com/ad-meliora/gender-diversity-in-greek-and-latin-grammar-ten-ancient-discussions-df371fe19af8)."

Hendrickson presents ten Greek and Latin sources spanning roughly a millenium that discuss the notion of grammatical gender. Our own categorization of grammatical gender in our analysis of languages like Greek derives directly from this tradition.  

Hendrickson's discussion raises a number of larger questions.  When we use particular forms of expression (such as conceiving of groups of nouns in terms of gender), we reflect an understanding of the world shared by speakers of our language. At the same time, our forms of expression teach and reinforce a view of the world to ourselves and to other speakers of our language, so that it seems natural or inevitable.   

In the podcast series "Hidden Brain," listen to part of the episode "[Watch your mouth](https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/watch-your-mouth/)" starting at 17:36. It's a discussion with a cognitive scientist, Lera Boroditsky, about how grammatical gender shapes cognitive structures.  (You may want to continue listening as she also discusses how different languages express agency.)

Have ever experienced confusion when you've studied or tried to use a second language? Can you think of times when you felt limited as a native speaker of English by how our language works?
