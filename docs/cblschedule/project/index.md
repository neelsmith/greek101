# Project schedule

You will develop a fall-semester project with three phrases of review. Each review is worth two points: one for submission on time, and one for satisfactory completion.  Successfully completing each phase allows you to continue to the next phase.  The review phases are:

1. Project proposal
2. Completed draft or rehearsal
3. Final submission or performance



## 1. Project proposal

You are encourage to work in small groups to submit a project proposal.  Your proposal should identify what kind of activity you would like to work on (developing material for a gallery handout, leading a docent tour, etc.), and what material on display in the WAM you want to focus on.  Please *identify material on display by museum inventory number*.  You will have the option of working in a small group on one of two default project options if you prefer.  Deadlines for review phase:

- **October 19**: initial project proposal submitted to your professor. If your group includes people from both sections of Greek 101, submit one copy to Professor Ebbott and one copy to Prof. Smith.  Your professor will review your proposal and evaluate it as satisfactory or unsatisfactory.  If you want to take part in one of the default project options, you must propose that in a written submission.
- **October 26**: final project proposal.  If your initial proposal needed revision, you may submit a revision up until October 26.  At that time, if you have not defined a satisfactory project, you will be assigned to one of the default projects.

## 2. Completed draft or rehearsal

Part of the feedback on your project proposal will be a timetable of one or more checkpoints to review your work in progress with specification of what will be included in a complete version of the project.

These checkpoints will culminate in submission of a complete version of the project.  If your final project is something like a written gallery guide, the submission will be a complete draft for review; if your final project is an event (talk, performance, docent tour), the submission will be a dress rehearsal.

Complete drafts or dress rehearsals will be due by **November 12**.


## 3. Final submission or performance

All fall-semester work must be completed by **December 12** (end of study period).
