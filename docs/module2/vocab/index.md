An irregular noun:  γυνή, γυναικός, ἡ, "woman." Note that the endings are all what you would expect for a third declension noun with genitive singular γυναικός: the only irregularity is that three forms do not have the "correct" persistent accent.  You do not have to produce these forms actively, but you should be able to recognize and identify them:

| Case  | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nominative  | γυνή | γυναῖκες |
| Genitive  | γυναικός   | γυναικῶν |
| Dative  | γυναικί | γυναιξί |
| Accusative  | γυναῖκα | γυναῖκας |



### Prepositions

Common prepositions constructed witih a single case:

1. ἀπό	+ genitive	: "away from, from"
1. εἰς	+ accusative	: "into, to, toward, in regard to"
1. ἐκ, ἐξ + genitive: 	"out of, from"
1. ἐν	+ dative	: "in, on, among, within"
1. σύν	+ dative	: "with"

> Note that the prepositions εἰς, ἐκ/ἐξ, and ἐν are proclitics, so they do not carry an accent or affect the accent of other words in a sentence.
