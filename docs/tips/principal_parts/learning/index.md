# Learning principal parts

You must memorize the principal parts of verbs, but there are common patterns that can help make this easier.

## Second principal part

The second principal normally adds -σ- to the stem of the first principal part.  

- κελεύω -> κελεύσω
- δείκνυμι -> δείξω


Contract verbs lengthen their vowel before the sigma:

- ποιέω -> ποιήσω
- τελευτάω -> τελευτήσω

## Third principal part

The stem of the third principal is normally identical to the stem of the second principal part!

- κελεύσω -> ἐκέλευσα
- δείξω -> ἔδειξα
- ποιήσω -> ἐποίησα

## Sixth principal part
