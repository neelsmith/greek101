## Goals and objectives

Greek 101 is the first semester of an ambitious new two-semester sequence to introduce you to the study of ancient Greek.  Our curriculum is inspired by the Latin 101-102 sequence developed by several members of our department at Holy Cross, led by [Professor Machado](https://dominicmachado.github.io). 




- Explain how language structures the world we live in
- Articulate how the Greek language has shaped and continues to shape structures of power in the modern world
- Read and pronounce Greek with confidence and accuracy
- Analyze syntax and sentence structure in Latin and English
- Translate complex ideas and sentences into Latin and English
- Read real, unedited Latin texts with minimal glossing
