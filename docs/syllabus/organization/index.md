# Organization of the course


## Textbook

The fall semester course is organized in three modules centered on three major ideas about the ancient Greek language. On our course website, each module identifies concrete objectives that will help you achieve the broader course goals summarized above.


The three modules correspond closely to modules 1-3 in the textbook we will be using.  You will be given a printed copy of the textbook in class. In addition, you can always find a current on-line version at [https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/](https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/), and can always download a PDF of the current textbook from [https://github.com/hellenike/textbook/raw/main/pdf/hellenike.pdf](https://github.com/hellenike/textbook/raw/main/pdf/hellenike.pdf).


After introducing features of the ancient Greek language, each module of the textbook includes reading that connects the topics you are studying to contemporary experience, and concludes with a reading selection from an authentic ancient text.  This year, our reading selections will be drawn from a defense speech composed by the orator Lysias in a murder trial.

Read sections 1 ("Hellênikê / ἑλληνική: an open-source introduction to ancient Greek") and 2 ("About this textbook") of the textbook to learn more about how the textbook is organized.

The textbook also has an accompanying youtube channel and playlist at [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhhpSgbqjgokrwa4HmReaGEptvqURz6Ns](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhhpSgbqjgokrwa4HmReaGEptvqURz6Ns).


## Technologies and mechanics of submitting assignments

All course material will be available on the course web site at [https://neelsmith.github.io/greek101/](https://neelsmith.github.io/greek101/). 

Written assignments should be written clearly and legibly in dark pencil on paper.
