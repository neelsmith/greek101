Our textbook is the first release of *Hellênikê / ἑλληνική: an open-source introduction to ancient Greek*, which you can purchase directly from the Classics Department Office.  The text will be available this fall in two installments:  packet 1 will be available the first week of classes; packet 2 will be available after fall break. 

You can always find a current on-line version at [https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/](https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/), and can always download a current PDF from [https://github.com/hellenike/textbook/raw/main/pdf/hellenike.pdf](https://github.com/hellenike/textbook/raw/main/pdf/hellenike.pdf).
