## Course requirements and grades

You determine your own course grade by satisfactorily completing a number of assignments in three categories:

- written and oral assignments for class preparation 
- longer portfolio assignments 
- work in CBL lab

All assignments will be graded satisfactory/unsatisfactory according to an explicit specification of requirements: if you complete all requirements, the assignment is satisfactory.




###  Class preparation

The course schedule includes twenty brief assignments as part of your routine class preparation, eighteen to be submitted in writing, and two oral assignments. Each assignment can earn up to two points: one point for a completed submission by 5:00 pm the day *before* class, and a second point for a grade of satisfactory.  The total points you can earn in this category is twenty.

The specifications for these assignments are straightforward: a submission is satisfactory if all responses are correct; errors are not satisfactory. If you submit an assignment on time (earning one point), but have an error, you may resubmit a corrected assignment as often as you like up until the deadline for final revisions for that module. When a revised submission is satisfactory a second point will be recorded for that assignment.




### Portfolio assignments

Over the course of the semester, you will develop a portfolio of ten longer assignments. Four of these will demonstrate mastery of basic features of language by analyzing and explaining forms and constructions; three will be analyses and translations of passages in Greek; three  will be compositions in Greek.

Throughout the semester, we will set aside class meetings to workshop drafts of these longer assignments.

As with class preparation assignments, each portfolio assignment earns one point for a complete submission on time, and a second point if it completes all requirements to achieve a satisfactory grade.  Like class preparation assignments, portfolio assignments may be revised as often as you like up to the deadline for revisions for each module. You can earn a total of 20 points in this category.


### CBL lab

Throughout the year, you will participate in a weekly CBL lab led by an alumna or alumnus of last year's Greek 101/102 course.  In the fall semester we will be working with the Worcester Art Museum on a project (MORE INFORMATION TBA) 

You will receive two grades for CBL lab work>

- participation: ten CBL sections are scheduled to meet at Holy Cross.  You earn one point for each section you attend, for a possible total of 10.
- project: satisfactory completion of projects in 3 steps. Each step can earn 2 points, for a total possible of 6 points.


## Determination of final course grade


Your course grade will be recorded from this table.  In the row for each grade, the numbers in each column represent the minimum number of points required in that category.
