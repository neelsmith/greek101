Acccommodations for disabilities
Any student who feels the need for accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact the Office of Disability Services to discuss support services available. The office can be reached by calling 508 793-3693 or by visiting Hogan Campus Center, room 215A.
If you are already registered with Disability Services, please let me know as soon as possible, so that I can take account of this in planning for tests or other course activities.
Academic honesty
You should be familiar with the College’s policy on Academic Honesty.
You are welcome to work on homework with classmates as long as everyone takes part fully on all parts of the assignment. Exams and quizzes are individual work;

unless otherwise instructed, you must take them without notes, books, or other aids (cell phones, etc.)
Students who permit others to copy their work on exams or homework assignments are guilty of academic dishonesty.
