## Week at a glance: Sept. 12 - Sept. 16

### MWF classes

We learn how to form the imperfect tense of *contract verbs*, and we add complete our coverage of the aorist indicative with the *second aorist*.



#### Reviewing the imperfect

Review the endings used with the third principal parts for the active and middle voices of the *first* aorist:


Endings for -ω verbs:

| Person and Number	| Active ending |	Middle  ending |
| --- | --- | --- |
| third singular |	-ε or -εν	| -ετο |
| third plural	| -ον	| -οντο |


Endings for -μι verbs are identical but without the initial (so-called "thematic" vowel):


| Person and Number	| Active ending |	Middle  ending |
| --- | --- | --- |
| third singular |	-	| -το |
| third plural	| -ν	| -ντο |


#### Reviewing the aorist

| Person and Number	| Active ending |	Middle  ending |
| --- | --- | --- |
| third singular |	-ε or -εν	| -ατο |
| third plural	| -ᾰν	| -αντο |


Memorize endings used with the third principal parts for the active and middle voices of the *second* aorist (identical to endings for active and middle voice of the imperfect of -ω verbs):

| Person and Number	| Active ending |	Middle  ending |
| --- | --- | --- |
| third singular |	-ε or -εν	| -ετο |
| third plural	| -ον	| -οντο |


Remember that all aorists with a sixth principal part use the same endings for the aorist passive:

| Person and  Number |	Passive Ending |
| --- | --- | 
| third singular	| -η |
| third plural	| -ησαν |


#### δίδωμι


Aorist (textbook section 4.7.5, "An important irregular verb" ), active voice:

- singular ἔδωκε
- plural ἔδοσαν


Middle:

- ἔδοτο
- ἔδοντο



Imperfect (textbook section 4.8.4, "Imperfect of δίδωμι"), active voice:

- singular ἐδίδου
- plural ἐδίδοσαν


Middle voice:

- singular ἐδίδοτο
- plural ἐδίδοντο
