## Week at a glance: Sept. 12-16


### MWF classes

Will cover no new material this week. Instead, we will apply the knowledge of verbs you gained in this module to longer portfolio assignments.  On Wednesday, we will explore word order in Greek.

You can use this youtube video to practice reading aloud the reading selection for Module 1.
