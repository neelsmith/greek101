# Contractions

When the stem of an -ω verb ends in α, ε, or ο, the stem contracts with the vowel of the ending, as summarized in this list of third person imperfect forms in the active voice.

| **-α + ο = -ω** | ὁράω, 3rd plural |  ὡρα- + ον  | ὥρων |
| **-ε + ε = -ει**  | ποιέω, 3rd singular | ἐποιε- + ε | ἐποίει | 
| **-ε + ο = -ου** | ποιέω, 3rd plural | ἐποιε- + ον | ἐποίουν |
