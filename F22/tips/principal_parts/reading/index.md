# Reading principal parts

## First principal part: all three voices of the imperfect (and the present)


What the endings tell you:

- -ω : use endings for -ω verbs in all three voices
- -ομαι: use endings for -ω verbs, no active voice
- -μι: use endings for -μι verbs in all three voices
- -μαι (*not* preceded by -ο-): use endings for -μι verbs, no active voice


## Third principal part: active and middle voice of the aorist

What the endings tell you:

- -α: use "first aorist" endings in all three voices
- -άμην: use "first aorist" endings, middle voice only
- -ον: use "second aorist" endings in all three voices (identical to imperfect endings of regular -ω verbs)
- -όμην: use "second aorist" endings, middle voice only (identical to imperfect endings of regular -ω verbs)


## Sixth principal part: passive voice of the aorist (and future)

There is only one set of endings to use with the sixth principal part.
