# Learning principal parts

You must memorize the principal parts of verbs, but there are common patterns that can help make this easier.

## Second principal part

The second principal normally adds -σ- to the stem of the first principal part.  

- κελεύω -> κελεύσω
- δείκνυμι -> δείξω


Contract verbs lengthen their vowel before the sigma:

- ποιέω -> ποιήσω
- τελευτάω -> τελευτήσω

## Third principal part

The stem of the third principal is normally identical to the stem of the second principal part!

- κελεύσω -> ἐκέλευσα
- δείξω -> ἔδειξα
- ποιήσω -> ἐποίησα

## Sixth principal part 

The sixth principal part normally adds -θ- to the stem of the first principal part.

- λύω ("unfasten", "loose") -> ἐλύθην

> **An exception**: κελεύω is one of a handful of verbs that insert a sigma before the theta:  κελεύω -> ἐκελεύσθην

Contract verbs lengthen the vowel of the stem:

- ποιέω -> ἐποιήθην
- τελευτάω -> ἐτελευτήθην

Stems ending in some consonants take on the aspirated quality of the theta:

- κ or γ + θ -> -χθ- (λέγω -> ἐλέχθην, δείκνυμι -> ἐδείχθην)
- π or β + θ -> -φθ- (λείπω, "leave behind, leave" -> ἐλείφθην)

Notice the relation in the stems of the second and sixth parts of ὁράω. ὄψομαι implies a stem ὀπ- + -σ-, as does ὤφθην.



> **Note**: πράττω is one of several verbs ending in -ττω deriving from an original stem in -κ- or -γ-. Notice how regular the relation of the second through sixth parts is: the stems of the second and third parts both look like πρακ + -σ- (πράξω, ἔπραξα) and the stem of the sixth part looks like πρακ + -θ- (ἐπράχθην).
