# Augment

The augment is a prefix that marks the indicative forms of a past-time verb tense. When a verb stem starts with a consonant, the augment is -ἐ (called the *syllabic* augment, since it adds another syllable to the word).  When the stem starts with a vowel, the vowel is lengthened (called *temporal* augment because of this lengthening). 

The most important changes to memorize are illustrated in this table with examples from your Module 1 vocabulary.


| Initial vowel | Augmented vowel | First principal part | Imperfect (3.singular) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| α | η | ἄγω | ἦγε |
| ε | η | ἔρχομαι | ἤρχοντο |
| ο | ω | ὁράω | ὥρα | 
 

In addition, initial ι or υ is lengthened ( ῑ , ῡ).

The same changes occur in diphthongs.  Note that diphthongs for η + ι and ω + ι are written ῃ and ῳ.

- αι -> ῃ
- αυ -> ηυ
- ει -> ῃ
- ευ -> ηυ
- οι -> ῳ
